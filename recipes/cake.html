    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A simple vanilla cake recipe is the perfect introductory cake for beginners, as well as a versatile standby for more experienced bakers to have on hand. While there’s a whole, huge, hypercalorific world of complicated cakes out there to explore, from red velvet cakes to lemon drizzle cakes, this easy cake recipe is where it all begins and it's worth mastering so you can get the basics of cake making under your belt before you start to jazz it up with flavour additions and decorating finesse.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g (6oz) margarine or softened butter</li>
        <li>175g (6oz) caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>175g (6oz) self-raising flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Heat the oven to 180°C (gas mark 4). Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base of the tin.</li></p>
        <p><li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.</li></p>
        <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.</li>
